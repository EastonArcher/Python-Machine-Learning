# Machine Learning Repository 📈
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and applications. 

## Projects 📂

### Music Recommendation 🎧
* This script utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to build a music recommender system. The model is trained on a dataset (music.csv) containing user information (age and gender) and their preferred music genres. The trained model generates a decision tree visualized in the music-recommender.dot file.

#### ❔How to Use 
  1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (pandas and scikit-learn).
  2. Run the script MusicRecommendationMachineLearning.py.
  3. Explore the generated decision tree in the music-recommender.dot file.

### Video Game Sales Predictor 🎮
* This script predicts global video game sales using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on a dataset (vgsales.csv) containing various features related to video games. The script preprocesses the data, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and evaluates the model's accuracy.

#### ❔How to Use 
  1. Install the required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn).
  2. Run the script VideoGameMachineLearning.py.
  3. Check the accuracy of the model printed in the console.
